[title sub="Written by Chris Graham, ocProducts"]ocPortal Tutorial: Installing on Google AppEngine[/title]

ocPortal is very heavily optimised so that pages load as quickly as possible. This tutorial will provide information on techniques and issues for increasing throughput, so that your site may support more visitors.

If you have need to be able to take particularly high load, considering getting [page="site:support"]the support of the experts[/page].

The following addons are not supported/useful on Google App Engine and must be uninstalled:
 - installer (serves no purpose on any ocPortal site, once install has finished)
 - devguide (generally not useful)
 - backup (not supported/relevant, use the GAE database backup tools)
 - uninstaller (not supported)
 - ldap (not supported)
 - themewizard (themeing on a live site is ill-advised, especially on the scale of the theme-wizard)
 - setupwizard (not supported)
 - stats (not supported due to the resource-usage-pattern, use Google Analytics)
 - import (not supported)

Note that the purpose of recommending uninstallation is actually primarily because AppEngine has some limits. We push up against these limits and hence need to get rid of redundant code to stay under them.

Even after removing these addons, you will still need to clear a bit more out to make sure you have fewer than 1000 files in the [tt]themes/default/templates[/tt] directory.
Remove one or two of the following addons (your choice which):
 - calendar
 - chat
 - ecommerce
 - shopping
 - galleries
 - pointstore
If you only removed one of the above, also remove one of the following:
 - authors
 - banners
 - downloads
 - newsletter
 - polls
 - quizzes
 - tickets
 - wiki
(Of course, you may remove more if you wish, or other addons)

If you find it annoying that you cannot have every ocPortal addon when using Google App Engine, you should consider that good sites are streamlined; very few (if any) websites should contain every ocPortal feature.
