[title sub="Written by Chris Graham, ocProducts"]ocPortal Tutorial: Notifications[/title]

ocPortal includes a highly-configurable notification system for members to be alerted on what is going on.

[title="2"]Choosing notifications[/title]

There are a wide number of notification types that members can receive.
Some are set to be enabled by default, and some are only available based on privileges.

Some notification types allow fine-grained control, allowing you to choose to receive them only for certain notification categories. For example, with forum topic notifications you can choose to receive them only for certain forums. This is similar to what some forum software calls 'tracking'.

[title="2"]Forms of receipt[/title]

You can receive notifications through a number of means:
 - E-mail
 - Digest e-mail (i.e. in batches)
 - Private topics
 - SMS (if configured, requires payment for each text message sent)
 - As web notifications

[title="3"]Web notifications[/title]

Web notifications are particularly cool. If you have the website open (or pinned open, which some browsers support), then visitors will be notified directly through the ocPortal user interface within a matter of seconds. From the list of recent/unread notifications, you can view an overlay with the full notification details, or a full page detailing all enabled web notifications from the last period of days.

Additionally, most platforms will allow native notification display:
 - in the Windows notification center (except on Internet Explorer, which does not support this [at the time of writing, where IE9 is the latest], see below)
 - in the MacOS notification center
 - in the Internet Explorer pinned site notification area
 - [s]in the main notification area of iPhone or Android phones[/s] -- unfortunately this doesn't work at the time of writing, as background pages don't run and most mobile browsers don't support HTML5 notifications

(If you don't want the interface to support this, you can remove the [tt]top_notifications[/tt] block from the default [tt]GLOBAL_HTML_WRAP[/tt] template and disable web notifications.)

[title="2"]Automatically monitor content you've touched[/title]

This option works to automatically set up a member to receive notifications on content they have interacted with. This happens at the point of them making an interaction -- it automatically sets up a monitor. It is not retroactive.

[title="2"]Smart Topic notification[/title]

The "Smart Topic notification" option works to stop members being flooded with notifications for a topic, until they've caught up. It sends them just one notification until they have read it again.

[title="2"]Debugging[/title]

You may wish to see what notification e-mails are being sent out.

The best way to debug notifications is to view the e-mail log, from Admin Zone > Audit > E-mail queue/log. You can see exactly what e-mails were sent out.

To see if someone is set up for notifications on some content, use the SU feature (switch user) to pretend to be them. You will see their settings reflected in the interface.

There's a config option, "Carbon-copy e-mail address". This address receives a copy of most e-mails the system sends out.
Note that it will only CC a notification e-mail to this address once, not once per notification.
