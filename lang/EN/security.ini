[strings]
DOC_SECURITY_LOGGING=The software monitors all web requests for potential security violations and thoroughly logs all suspicious activity. In addition, failed logins are logged, so that you can see if users are trying to illicitly access the accounts of members.
ABSORB_PERMISSIONS=Absorb usergroup-permissions
USERGROUPS_WITH_NO_PERMISSIONS=The following usergroups do not have any privileges associated with them and thus should absorb from the appropriate usergroup: <strong>{1}</strong>. Be careful with this interface: you should never absorb from administrative usergroups unless you are sure it is something you wish to do.
DOC_ABSORB_PERMISSIONS=The absorb usergroup-permissions screen allows you to quickly get new usergroups set up with appropriate permissions, by absorbing some from an existing usergroup. Users of OCF (the inbuilt forum system) do not have access to this, as it is automated for them.
PERMISSIONS_FROM=Permissions are <strong>taken</strong> from this usergroup.
PERMISSIONS_TO=Permissions are <strong>placed</strong> into this usergroup (after first deleting what may be currently there currently).
SSL_CONFIGURATION=SSL/TLS (HTTPS) configuration
SSL_PAGE_SELECT=Select which pages you would like to use the HTTPS <abbr title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</abbr>/<abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> protocol. An HTTPS page view encrypts bi-directional traffic securely (to avoid unauthorised tampering and interception by third-parties) but also imposes a performance cost on the server. To use HTTPS you must have an SSL/TLS certificate installed on your server, and have the website files accessible via both HTTPS and HTTP variants of the base-URL.
DOC_INVESTIGATE_USER=The lookup module links to a number of external web tools that can find information about IP addresses. These tools are:\n - Reverse-DNS lookup - this will find try and find a domain name attached to the IP address\n - DNS lookup - this will find try and find a domain name attached to the IP address, and then the IP address attached to the domain name: with a second IP address, further analysis might be performed\n - WHOIS query - this will try and find a domain name attached to the IP address, and then try to find real-world details about the registered owner of that domain name\n - Ping - this will see if the computer with the IP address responds to &lsquo;pings&rsquo;; servers often will, but desktop computers rarely will\n - Tracert - this will find the network route between the server that provides this web tool, and the server of the IP address; it provides an impression of the locality and connectivity of the associated computer\n - Geo-lookup - this will try and find the geographical location of the IP address; it can be widely inaccurate however: for example, in the past UK AOL users have been shown as being located in the US
DOC_SSL=If you have a dedicated server which is configured with an SSL/TLS certificate, tied into your domain, and if the server is configured to use the same file system for HTTPS as for HTTP, then you may choose to make certain pages work via HTTPS. Before you may select which pages to use, you must enable the "HTTPS support" option from the "General" subsection of the "Security/Usergroup configuration" section of the configuration.
SECURITY=Security
HTTPS_DISABLED=HTTPS (<abbr title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</abbr>/<abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>) support is disabled.<br />If it is desired for certain website pages to load under HTTPS, then the support may be turned on in the <a href="{1}">configuration</a>.<br /><br />Please be advised that you will need an SSL/TLS certificate, that you will need a properly configured server, and that HTTPS support imposes a (very) small performance impact in this software's URL-generation code.
SECURITY_LOGGING=Security logging
FAILED_LOGINS=Failed logins
SECURITY_ALERTS=Security alerts
VIEW_ALERT=View security alert ({1})
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_types=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which may be uploaded by users. Leave blank if you want to just apply core security restrictions, and nothing further.
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_images=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which are valid images for inline display.
SECURITY_PAGE_CLEANUP=You may tick-off (check-off) alerts that you wish to erase from the record. Typically this is useful if you have confirmed the alerts to be false alarms and do not want to see them again in the future.
POST_DATA_EXPLANATION=Any web request can be classified as either a &lsquo;GET&rsquo; request or a &lsquo;POST&rsquo; request. &lsquo;GET&rsquo; requests are carried out purely via a URL, whilst &lsquo;POST&rsquo; requests include additional data. The following data was posted when the security alert was raised&hellip;
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_security=Security logging
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_ssl=SSL/TLS (HTTPS) configuration
HACKER_DETECTED=Hacker/evil-bot: {1}
