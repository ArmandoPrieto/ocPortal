When you create the app make sure the app is configured for the real URL and domain name of your site.
CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_secret_code=The Facebook-generated 'secret' associated with your API key.
CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_uid=Optional. The Facebook page ID (a number) where syndicated content goes to, and associated to the site via OpenGraph. When you authorise Facebook syndication (from the Setup drop-down menu), you must be logged in to a Facebook account (on Facebook's end) that is an administrator of this page. Note that posts to the page will be shown as being from this Facebook account too. If you prefer, you can enter a user ID (for syndicating to a Facebook user's wall) or group ID (for syndicating to a group's wall) into this setting, which will work too, assuming again that you are logged in appropriately on Facebook's end. If you leave this setting blank then when you setup Facebook authorisation it will work out who you are logged in as, and enter that user ID here (i.e. posts will then go to your own wall).

CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_allow_signups=Whether to allow automatic signup via logging in using a Facebook account. If you disable this, member's will still be able to associate their <em>existing</em> account with Facebook and sign in using it. Existing accounts are associated when you're logged in, and once associated, future login will always need to be via Facebook.
FACEBOOK_SIGNUPS_DISABLED=Automatic Facebook signup has not been enabled. You'll need to get an account normally, and you then have the option to associate that account with Facebook.
